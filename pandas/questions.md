# Section 5: Pandas
## 29. Pandas - Useful Methods - Statistical Information and Sorting
Here are 20 questions, including both conceptual and coding questions, about the text:

### Conceptual Questions:
1. What is the purpose of the `df.describe()` method in Pandas?
2. How can you sort a DataFrame by multiple columns in Pandas?
3. What does the `ascending` parameter in `sort_values()` control?
4. How does `idxmax()` and `idxmin()` help when analyzing a DataFrame?
5. What does `df.corr()` return, and what does it represent?
6. Why is it important to understand correlations between columns in a dataset?
7. How can you use the `value_counts()` method, and for what type of data is it useful?
8. What's the difference between `unique()` and `nunique()` in Pandas?
9. When would you use the `replace()` method instead of the `map()` method in a DataFrame?
10. How do the `duplicated()` and `drop_duplicates()` methods work?
11. What does the `between()` method allow you to do with a DataFrame?
12. How do `nlargest()` and `nsmallest()` differ from just using `sort_values()`?
13. When would it be useful to use `df.sample()` on a DataFrame?
14. What is the main difference between using `sample(n=5)` and `sample(frac=0.1)`?

### Coding Questions:
15. Write a code snippet to sort the "total_bill" column in descending order.
16. How would you find the row in a DataFrame with the highest "tip" value using `idxmax()`?
17. Using Pandas, write a code snippet that shows how to replace all instances of "female" with "F" and "male" with "M" in a DataFrame column.
18. Write a code snippet to drop duplicated rows in a DataFrame.
19. How can you filter a DataFrame to only include rows where the "total_bill" is between 10 and 50, inclusive?
20. Write a code snippet to find the 5 smallest values in the "tip" column.
